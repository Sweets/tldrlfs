# Shells

Shells provide you a means to interface with your machine by allowing you to call binaries and pass arguments to them as well.
While they all mostly provide the same in terms of base functionality, that is calling binaries and giving the called binaries arguments from the user, they each have their own additional functionality that they provide.
